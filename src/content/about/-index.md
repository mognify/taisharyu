**Hyoho Taisha-ryu** is a classical Japanese martial system (*koryu bujutsu*) founded by **Marume Nagayoshi** (1540–1629), a retainer of the Sagara clan in Higo Province. He studied directly under **Kamiizumi Ise-no-Kami Nobutsuna**, founder of Shinkage-ryu, and received full transmission (*menkyo kaiden*). From this foundation, Marume developed a distinct and comprehensive martial tradition that came to be known as Hyoho Taisha-ryu.

The term **Hyoho** (兵法) refers not merely to technique, but to strategy: the integrated understanding of combat dynamics, psychological composure, and decisive action. **Taisha** (体捨) means “casting off the body” — not in the sense of recklessness, but of the profound psychological transformation required to act without fear of death. This concept anchors the school’s strategy, emphasizing clarity of decision and immediacy of action even in life-threatening encounters.

Taisha-ryu is a **sogo bujutsu**, a comprehensive martial system designed for practical conflict during the late Sengoku and early Edo periods. It includes:

- **Kenjutsu** – swordsmanship, with long sword, short sword, and dual wielding  
- **Iaijutsu** – drawing and cutting from the scabbard  
- **Sojutsu** – spear techniques  
- **Naginatajutsu** – glaive techniques  
- **Tantojutsu** – knife techniques  
- **Jujutsu** – unarmed grappling  
- **Tessenjutsu** – iron fan combat, used often in confined or surprise scenarios

The methods are not sports-based nor optimized for dueling; they are shaped by battlefield conditions and the necessity of survival. Taisha-ryu kata encode principles of timing, spatial awareness, and psychological manipulation. They are often performed slowly and precisely, focusing on internal alignment, gaze (*metsuke*), breath control, and movement economy.

Strategically, the school favors:

- Disruption over force-on-force opposition  
- Off-angle entries (*irimi*) instead of direct attacks  
- Controlled posture (*kamae*) that conceals intent  
- Minimal telegraphing and subtle shifts in rhythm or weight  

<br><br>

These principles are integrated into every level of training and form the strategic core of Taisha-ryu’s pedagogy. The aim is to eliminate hesitation through familiarity with danger and awareness of human nature under stress.

<br><br>

Philosophically, Hyoho Taisha-ryu transmits a deep internal discipline grounded in a pre-modern worldview. The practitioner is expected not only to refine physical technique but to confront fear, ego, and illusion. The art is transformative: it develops resolve, subtlety of perception, and the ability to act from a clear mind.

<br><br>

The transmission of the art follows the traditional **menkyo system**, not modern ranking belts. Students are taught directly and progressively, with responsibility placed on each individual to observe, internalize, and inquire. Advancement is based on depth of understanding and demonstration of internal alignment with the school's core principles.

<br><br>

Today, Hyoho Taisha-ryu is maintained through the leadership of the current headmaster, **Yamakita Takenori**, with instruction and support from senior practitioners such as **Uehara Eriko** and **Takahiro Yamamoto**. The school remains active in Japan and abroad, committed to the faithful preservation and clear transmission of its martial legacy.

<br><br>

Those seeking to study Hyoho Taisha-ryu must come with sincerity, patience, and a willingness to change. The school does not offer shortcuts, nor does it promise empowerment through imitation. It offers an exacting path to clarity, formed in an era where hesitation could cost one’s life — and where freedom from fear was the foundation of decisive action.
