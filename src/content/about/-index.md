**Hyoho Taisha-ryu** is a classical Japanese martial system (koryu bujutsu) founded in the early 17th century by **Marume Nagayoshi** (1540–1629), a retainer of the Sagara clan in Higo Province (modern Kumamoto). Drawing from his study under Kamiizumi Nobutsuna, founder of Shinkage-ryu, Marume synthesized battlefield method, sword theory, and spiritual clarity into a unified strategic art: Hyoho Taisha-ryu.

The term **"Hyoho"** (兵法) denotes martial strategy—encompassing tactics, timing, structure, and mind. The term **"Taisha"** (タイ捨) implies "casting off the body," a phrase reflecting the school's essential principle: release from fear of death, enabling decisive action and clarity under duress. The practitioner enters combat not to dominate but to transcend the self.

## Core Disciplines

Hyoho Taisha-ryu is a **sogo bujutsu** (composite martial system), transmitting knowledge across multiple weapons and domains:

- **Kenjutsu** – sword techniques for single and dual swords
- **Iaijutsu** – seated and standing sword-draw methods
- **Sojutsu** – spear combat
- **Naginatajutsu** – glaive usage, especially against cavalry
- **Tantojutsu** – knife defense and offense
- **Jujutsu** – grappling and unarmed methods
- **Tessenjutsu** – iron fan techniques, often used in court or disarmed settings

These forms (kata) are not choreography but mnemonic frameworks to internalize spatial awareness, timing, control, and psychological strategy.

## Purpose and Function

The purpose of Hyoho Taisha-ryu is not sport, nor casual self-defense. It is a vehicle for refining perception, movement, and resolve. Rooted in the logic of mortal combat, its training is designed to:

- Discipline the body through refined mechanics
- Sharpen the mind through exposure to strategic conflict
- Strengthen the spirit by detaching from self-preservation

Through its curriculum, practitioners study **combat as transformation**: training to eliminate hesitation, fear, and thought-lag, thus enabling a calm and lucid state even when stakes are life-defining.

## Lineage and Transmission

For over 400 years, the art has been handed down through a direct transmission line. In modern times, three key figures have carried its methods into public knowledge while preserving its integrity:

- **Yamakita Takenori**, 15th-generation soke (headmaster), has worked to preserve, refine, and document the school's deep internal logic and pedagogy. His leadership balances faithful preservation with lucid instruction.
- **Uehara Eriko**, senior instructor and long-time disciple, plays a key role in practice continuity, instructional integrity, and the international communication of Taisha-ryu principles.
- **Takahiro Yamamoto**, active practitioner and assistant instructor, supports technical transmission and engagement with new students and modern platforms.

Each continues the work of adapting traditional knowledge to contemporary students without diluting its depth or context.

## Joining the Practice

Hyoho Taisha-ryu is open to sincere individuals seeking more than physical technique. It demands consistency, humility, and self-honesty. While physical conditioning and coordination are trained, the true challenge lies in confronting internal obstacles: indecision, ego, tension, and attachment.

The school does not teach how to win; it teaches how to stand, see, move, and decide.
