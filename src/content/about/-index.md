## Origin of Hyoho Taisha-ryu

Hyoho Taisha-ryu is a classical Japanese martial tradition (koryu bujutsu) that originated during the Sengoku period, a time of near-constant warfare in Japan. It was founded by **Marume Nagayoshi (1540–1629)**, a retainer of the Sagara clan in southern Kyushu. He developed the system based on his experience in battle, his exposure to various martial traditions, and his studies under the prominent strategist **Kamiizumi Ise-no-Kami Nobutsuna**, founder of Shinkage-ryu.<br><br>

Marume Nagayoshi received formal transmission (menkyo kaiden) from Kamiizumi and later synthesized his learning into his own system: Taisha-ryu. The name can be translated as “Great Teaching School of Strategy” (Hyoho = military strategy, Taisha = great teacher or instruction, Ryu = school). Taisha-ryu was registered with the Satsuma domain as a formal martial system and was practiced by warrior families in the region for generations.<br><br>

## Lineage and Transmission

Since its founding in the 16th century, Hyoho Taisha-ryu has been transmitted through a direct, teacher-to-student lineage, known in Japanese as **keizu** (descent or transmission line). This process is governed by the menkyo system, which issues formal licenses for levels of mastery and transmission rights. The tradition has been preserved across multiple generations by successive headmasters (sōke), each entrusted with maintaining the integrity of the art.<br><br>

Throughout the Edo period and into the modern era, Hyoho Taisha-ryu remained a private tradition within select lineages in Kumamoto and surrounding areas. Its survival into the 20th century was largely due to the efforts of key instructors who continued to train and document the art during times when many koryu were declining or lost.<br><br>

In the postwar period, the tradition was reorganized and made accessible to a wider public under the guidance of recognized successors. The current sōke, operating from Japan, maintains official authority over the school and its branches. Instructors abroad operate under formal licensure, and all instruction adheres to the structural and pedagogical framework defined by the mainline.<br><br>

Hyoho Taisha-ryu remains a closed, curriculum-based art with no modification permitted without express authorization. The lineage is documented and traceable, making it one of the few remaining koryu with a continuous, verifiable transmission from the Sengoku period to the present.<br><br>

## Purpose of Hyoho Taisha-ryu

The central purpose of Hyoho Taisha-ryu is the transmission of battlefield-tested strategic and combative methods developed during Japan’s feudal period. It was designed not for sport or performance, but to prepare warriors for life-and-death encounters, emphasizing both physical skill and psychological readiness.<br><br>

Unlike modern martial arts which may prioritize competition, exercise, or self-defense in a civilian context, Hyoho Taisha-ryu maintains a focus on:
 - **Tactical movement and strategic engagement**
 - **Mental composure and decisiveness under pressure**
 - **Accurate preservation of historical technique and intent**

Training is conducted through **kata-based transmission**, where the practitioner learns predetermined forms that encode principles of timing, distance, deception, and finishing movements. These forms are not choreographed routines but distillations of actual combative experience from the warring states era.<br><br>

More broadly, Hyoho Taisha-ryu also serves a cultural and philosophical function. It transmits the ethical framework, etiquette, and strategic thinking of a historical warrior class. This includes:
- Maintaining discipline through ritualized structure
- Cultivating awareness and composure (heijoshin)
- Reinforcing values of duty, humility, and precision

For modern practitioners, the purpose is both historical preservation and personal cultivation through the lens of classical strategy and martial realism.<br><br>

## Locations Where Hyoho Taisha-ryu Is Practiced

Hyoho Taisha-ryu is a **closed transmission system**, meaning it is taught only by licensed instructors with permission from the headmaster. As such, practice locations are few and carefully managed to ensure fidelity to the tradition.<br><br>

### Japan
- **Main Dojo (Sōhonbu):** Located in **Kumamoto Prefecture**, this is the headquarters of the school, where the current headmaster resides and where senior instruction takes place.
- Additional practice groups may exist in other regions of Japan under direct oversight.<br><br>

### International Branches
Recognized branches and study groups operate in a small number of countries under formal license. These include:
- **North America:** Select dojo in the United States and Canada with instructors licensed to teach the full curriculum or in limited capacity.
- **Europe:** Practice groups in countries such as the UK, France, and Germany, depending on the current affiliations and travel of senior instructors.
- **Australia:** Occasional seminars and private study groups led by approved practitioners.

Due to the nature of koryu, not all locations are publicly advertised. Prospective students are advised to **contact the main organization or regional representatives** for accurate information and to arrange introductions through proper channels.<br><br>

All practice outside Japan is subject to oversight by the sōke and may involve periodic visits, seminars, and skill evaluations to maintain alignment with the mainline teachings.
