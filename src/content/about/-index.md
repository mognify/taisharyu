## Origin of Hyoho Taisha-ryu

Hyoho Taisha-ryu is a classical Japanese martial tradition (koryu bujutsu) that originated during the Sengoku period, a time of near-constant warfare in Japan. It was founded by **Marume Nagayoshi (1540–1629)**, a retainer of the Sagara clan in southern Kyushu. He developed the system based on his experience in battle, his exposure to various martial traditions, and his studies under the prominent strategist **Kamiizumi Ise-no-Kami Nobutsuna**, founder of Shinkage-ryu.<br><br>

Marume Nagayoshi received formal transmission (menkyo kaiden) from Kamiizumi and later synthesized his learning into his own system: Taisha-ryu. The name can be translated as “Great Teaching School of Strategy” (Hyoho = military strategy, Taisha = great teacher or instruction, Ryu = school). Taisha-ryu was registered with the Satsuma domain as a formal martial system and was practiced by warrior families in the region for generations.<br><br>

## Lineage and Transmission

Hyoho Taisha-ryu (兵法タイ捨流) was founded in the late 16th century by **Marume Kurando-no-suke Nagayoshi (丸目蔵人佑長)**, a samurai from Yatsushiro in the Sagara domain of Higo Province (modern-day Kumamoto Prefecture). Marume was a distinguished student of **Kamiizumi Ise-no-Kami Nobutsuna**, the founder of Shinkage-ryu. After years of rigorous training and receiving the menkyo kaiden (license of full transmission) from Kamiizumi, Marume established his own school, integrating his battlefield experiences and philosophical insights.<br><br>

The lineage of Hyoho Taisha-ryu has been preserved through a direct succession of headmasters (sōke), each entrusted with maintaining the school's teachings and traditions. The succession is as follows:<br><br>

1. Founder: Marume Iwami no kami Nyūdō Tesssai Fujiwara Nagayoshi (丸目石見守入道徹斉蔵人佐藤原長恵)
2. Konose Gunsuke Ōkami Tadayuki (神瀬軍助太神惟幸)
3. Sagara Shōjirō Yoritake (相良庄次郎頼武)
4. Sagara Sahei Nagafusa (相良左兵衛長房)
5. Konose Goemon Nyūdō Isai Ōkami Tadanobu (神瀬五右衛門入道牟哉太神惟宜)
6. Oda Shichirouemon Fujiwara Sadanori (小田七郎右衛門 藤原定矩)
7. Oda Sekika Fujiwara Sadanori (小田夕可 藤原定紀)
8. Oda Naozaemon Fujiwara Sadayoshi (小田直左衛門藤原定能)
9. Oda Kindazaemon Fujiwara Sadabumi (小田金駄左衛門藤原定記)
10. Oda Hachirouzaemon Fujiwara Sadanao(小田八郎左衛門藤原定直 )
11. Samuda Chūzō Fujiwara Yoshioki (佐厶田忠蔵藤原良興)
12. Oda Sekika Fujiwara Sadataka (小田夕可藤原定孝)
13. Yamakita Takenori Fujiwara Sadamune (山北 竹任藤原定宗)
14. Kino Takao Fujiwara Sadataka (木野敬夫藤原定敬)
15. Uehara Eriko Fujiwara Hidesada (上原エリ子藤原英定)<br><br>

Throughout its history, Hyoho Taisha-ryu has remained a closed transmission system, taught only by licensed instructors under the authority of the sōke. The school's teachings have been preserved through traditional methods, including the menkyo licensing system and the study of densho (transmission scrolls). This meticulous approach ensures the integrity and continuity of the art from its inception to the present day.<br><br>

The current sōke, **Uehara Eriko**, oversees the Ryusenkan Dojo in Yatsushiro, Kumamoto, which serves as the main dojo (sōhonbu) of Hyoho Taisha-ryu. Under her leadership, the school continues to uphold its centuries-old traditions while also engaging in efforts to document and preserve its rich history for future generations.<br><br>

## Purpose of Hyoho Taisha-ryu

The central purpose of Hyoho Taisha-ryu is the transmission of battlefield-tested strategic and combative methods developed during Japan’s feudal period. It was designed not for sport or performance, but to prepare warriors for life-and-death encounters, emphasizing both physical skill and psychological readiness.<br><br>

Unlike modern martial arts which may prioritize competition, exercise, or self-defense in a civilian context, Hyoho Taisha-ryu maintains a focus on:
 \+ Tactical movement and strategic engagement
 \+ Mental composure and decisiveness under pressure
 \+ Accurate preservation of historical technique and intent

Training is conducted through **kata-based transmission**, where the practitioner learns predetermined forms that encode principles of timing, distance, deception, and finishing movements. These forms are not choreographed routines but distillations of actual combative experience from the warring states era.<br><br>

More broadly, Hyoho Taisha-ryu also serves a cultural and philosophical function. It transmits the ethical framework, etiquette, and strategic thinking of a historical warrior class. This includes:
- Maintaining discipline through ritualized structure
- Cultivating awareness and composure (heijoshin)
- Reinforcing values of duty, humility, and precision

For modern practitioners, the purpose is both historical preservation and personal cultivation through the lens of classical strategy and martial realism.<br><br>

### Japan
- **Main Dojo (Sōhonbu):** Located in **Kumamoto Prefecture**, this is the headquarters of the school, where the current headmaster resides and where senior instruction takes place.
- Additional practice groups may exist in other regions of Japan under direct oversight.<br><br>

All practice outside Japan is subject to oversight by the sōke and may involve periodic visits, seminars, and skill evaluations to maintain alignment with the mainline teachings.
