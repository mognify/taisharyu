Yamakita Takenori was the 13th headmaster of Taisha Ryu, a traditional Japanese martial arts school. He was born in the Meiji era in 1883 and carried the tradition of Taisha Ryu into the 20th century. Yamakita appointed his son Yamakita Takenori as the 13th head of the school and entrusted it to his two certified Shihan, Yamamoto Takahiro and Tazoe Shin-Ichiro.

Yamakita's grandson became the 14th headmaster of the school, and the current 15th headmaster is Uehara Eriko, the granddaughter of Yamakita-sensei.
