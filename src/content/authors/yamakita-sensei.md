13th Headmaster (S≈çke). Previous head of the ryu and pivotal figure in its postwar revival.
<br><br>
Yamakita Takenori revitalized and stabilized Hyoho Taisha-ryu after a period of dormancy. A scholar-practitioner, he emphasized the inner structure of kata and the mental strategy of hyoho. His work ensured the art would continue into future generations.
<br><br>
Yamakita's grandson became the 14th headmaster of the school, and the current 15th headmaster is Uehara Eriko, the granddaughter of Yamakita-sensei.
