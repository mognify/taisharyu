13th Sōke (Headmaster) 第十五代 宗家.

Preserving and transmitting the complete art of Hyoho Taisha-ryu in the modern era.
<br><br>
Granddaughter of Yamakita Takenori, Uehara Eriko assumed the role of Sōke to carry forward the living tradition of Taisha-ryu. With discipline, clarity, and deep humility, she guides the school's evolution while maintaining its classical heart.
