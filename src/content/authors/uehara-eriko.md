Uehara Eriko 第十五代 宗家 (15th Sōke) 15th Headmaster (Sōke)

Preserving and transmitting the complete art of Hyoho Taisha-ryu in the modern era.

Granddaughter of Yamakita Takenori, Uehara Eriko assumed the role of Sōke to carry forward the living tradition of Taisha-ryu. With discipline, clarity, and deep humility, she guides the school's evolution while maintaining its classical heart.
