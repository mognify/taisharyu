Takahiro Yamamoto is a prominent figure in the Hyoho Taisha-ryu, a koryu kenjutsu school that originated in the late 16th century in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. He acts as the technical leader of the school and is a direct disciple of the late Yamakita Takenori, the 13th Soke of Hyoho Taisha-ryu. Currently, the school is led by Uehara Eriko, the first female Soke of this school, and Yamamoto Takahiro assists her as the technical leader.

Yamamoto Takahiro has been actively promoting Hyoho Taisha-ryu both within Japan and internationally. He has participated in various events, accepted non-Japanese students, and established study groups in Europe.
 The school emphasizes practicality and adaptability, reflecting the era of civil war in which it was created. It includes deep stances and movements designed for battlefield conditions, making it a very practical style of kenjutsu.

In addition to his role in Hyoho Taisha-ryu, Takahiro Yamamoto is also known as a multidisciplinary artist and choreographer, whose work focuses on the effects of time and the presence of nothingness.
