## Takahiro Yamamoto: Technical Leader of Hyoho Taisha-ryu

**Takahiro Yamamoto** (山本 隆博), born on March 21, 1970, in Yatsushiro City, Kumamoto Prefecture, is a distinguished martial artist and the current Shihan (master instructor) of Hyoho Taisha-ryu. He serves as the Kancho (head) of the Ryū-Sen-Kan Dōjō, the school's headquarters in Yatsushiro, and acts as the technical leader under the 15th Sōke (headmaster), **Eriko Uehara**.

### Early Training and Advancement

Yamamoto began his journey in Hyoho Taisha-ryu on April 5, 1995, under the tutelage of the 13th Sōke, **Takenori Yamakita**. His dedication and rigorous training led him to receive the **Menkyo Kaiden** (license of full transmission) and the **Ikkoku Ichinin Denju** ("sole instructor of the region" certificate) on February 26, 2011. Following this, he established the Ryū-Sen-Kan Dōjō on May 7, 2011, inheriting the name from his teacher's dojo.

### Role in the School's Leadership

After the passing of Sōke Yamakita, Eriko Uehara, his granddaughter, assumed the position of the 15th Sōke. Yamamoto, as her senior and direct disciple of the late Sōke, took on the role of technical leader, providing guidance and support in preserving and transmitting the school's teachings. His position is particularly significant in a tradition where female Sōke are rare, and his support has been instrumental in maintaining the school's integrity and continuity.

### Contributions to Hyoho Taisha-ryu

Yamamoto has been pivotal in both preserving the traditional aspects of Hyoho Taisha-ryu and adapting its teachings for contemporary practice. His contributions include:

- **Shintai Sōsa (Body Management):** He introduced exercises focusing on body mechanics, emphasizing a low center of gravity, internal and external awareness, and efficient movement. These practices are designed to enhance the practitioner's physical and mental connection, aligning with the school's combative principles.

- **International Outreach:** Yamamoto has actively promoted Hyoho Taisha-ryu beyond Japan, conducting seminars and establishing study groups in Europe and Australia. His efforts have made the school's teachings accessible to a global audience, fostering a broader appreciation for traditional Japanese martial arts.

- **Cultural Integration Projects:** He initiated the "SABURAU" project, a Samurai Expo that combines traditional Japanese culture with contemporary arts like manga and anime. This initiative aims to engage modern audiences and ensure the transmission of traditional culture to future generations.

- **Publication Efforts:** Recognizing the lack of English-language resources on Hyoho Taisha-ryu, Yamamoto has been involved in translating and publishing materials to make the school's teachings more accessible to non-Japanese practitioners.

### Philosophy and Vision

Yamamoto's approach to martial arts emphasizes self-refinement and mental composure. Inspired by his teacher's words, "Always remember to tell yourself, this is for the training of your mind," he views martial practice as a means to achieve inner calm and personal growth. His vision includes preserving the school's traditions while adapting its teachings to resonate with contemporary practitioners, ensuring its relevance and vitality in the modern world.
