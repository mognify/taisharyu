Takahiro Yamamoto is a prominent figure in the Hyoho Taisha-ryu, a koryu kenjutsu school that originated in the late 16th century in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. He acts as the technical leader of the school and is a direct disciple of the late Yamakita Takenori, the 13th Soke of Hyoho Taisha-ryu. Currently, the school is led by Uehara Eriko, the first female Soke of this school, and Yamamoto Takahiro assists her as the technical leader.

Yamamoto Takahiro has been actively promoting Hyoho Taisha-ryu both within Japan and internationally. He has participated in various events, accepted non-Japanese students, and established study groups in Europe.
