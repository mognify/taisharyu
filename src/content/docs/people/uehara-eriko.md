15th Sōke (Headmaster) 第十五代 宗家.

---

**Uehara Eriko** (上原エリ子藤原英定) serves as the 15th sōke (headmaster) of **Hyōhō Taisha-ryū**, a traditional Japanese martial arts school (koryū) founded in the late 16th century. She is the granddaughter of the 13th sōke, **Yamakita Takenori**, and the first woman to assume the headmaster position in the school's history.

### Background and Succession

Following the passing of her grandfather, Yamakita Takenori, the sōkeshop briefly passed to her cousin, **Kino Takao**, who served as the 14th sōke. Subsequently, Uehara Eriko was appointed as the 15th sōke, marking a significant moment in the school's lineage.

### Leadership and Preservation Efforts

As sōke, Uehara oversees the **Ryū-Sen-Kan Dōjō** in Yatsushiro, Kumamoto Prefecture, which serves as the headquarters of Hyōhō Taisha-ryū. She works closely with **Yamamoto Takahiro**, the school's shihan (master instructor) and technical leader, to maintain the integrity of the school's teachings and ensure accurate transmission of its curriculum.

### Contributions to Research and Outreach

Under Uehara's supervision, the **Taisha-ryū Historical Research Group (THRG)** was established to study and preserve the school's rich history. The THRG focuses on:

- Analyzing existing Taisha-ryū documents
- Researching the school's historical development and dissemination
- Acquiring and preserving historical documents
- Creating resources for future research and education

### International Engagement

Uehara has actively promoted Hyōhō Taisha-ryū internationally. In January 2025, she, along with Yamamoto Takahiro, visited the Sydney Study Group in Australia, conducting seminars and demonstrations to share the school's teachings with a global audience.

### Demonstrations and Public Appearances

Uehara has participated in various public demonstrations to showcase Hyōhō Taisha-ryū. Notably, she performed at the **Meiji Jingu Kobudo Demonstration** in 2019, highlighting the school's techniques and philosophy to a broader audience.
