# Uehara Eriko – 15th Generation Sōke of Hyoho Taisha-ryū

**Uehara Eriko** (上原エリ子, Fujiwara Hidesada, b. 1981) is the 15th-generation *sōke* (headmaster) of **Hyoho Taisha-ryū Kenjutsu**, one of Japan’s classical martial arts (*koryū bujutsu*). Her succession marks a historic shift as the first woman to lead the ryu in over 450 years of its history. Uehara is the granddaughter of the 13th sōke, Yamakita Takenori, and formally succeeded the headmastership on **August 1, 2015**, at age 34.

## Early Life and Background

- **Birth:** January 28, 1981, Hitoyoshi, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan  
- **Family Lineage:** Granddaughter of Yamakita Takenori (13th sōke); daughter of two Taisha-ryū practitioners  
- **Relocation:** Moved to Kumamoto City in early childhood; returned to Hitoyoshi area at age 20  
- **Given Name in the Ryu:** Fujiwara Hidesada (藤原秀貞), continuing the classical tradition of adopting a formal lineage name

Uehara Eriko grew up in a household where the legacy of Hyoho Taisha-ryū was not only respected but lived. Her grandfather, Yamakita Takenori, often demonstrated techniques at community events and dojo seminars. These early impressions inspired her to begin training at a young age.

## Martial Training

- **Formal Training Start:** Around age 9–10  
- **Initial Teacher:** Grandfather Yamakita Takenori  
- **Subsequent Instructors:** Yamamoto Takahiro, Tazoe Shin-ichiro  
- **Primary Dojo:** Ryū-Sen-Kan Dojo, Yatsushiro  
- **License of Full Transmission (Menkyo Kaiden):** January 1, 2013

Her training involved not just technical mastery, but also deep immersion in the philosophies and cultural customs of the ryu. She was guided through the traditional licensing system, culminating in her reception of Menkyo Kaiden, which signifies full mastery and the authority to transmit the system in its entirety.

## Assumption of Sōke Title

- **Date of Succession:** August 1, 2015  
- **Ceremony Location:** Aoi Aso Shrine, Hitoyoshi  
- **Predecessor:** Yamamoto Takahiro (14th sōke; succeeded following Yamakita Takenori’s death in 2008)

In 2015, a formal succession ceremony was held at the historically significant Aoi Aso Shrine, during which Uehara Eriko was publicly recognized as the 15th sōke of Hyoho Taisha-ryū. Her assumption of the title was met with both admiration and curiosity, given the rarity of female sōke within traditional *koryū* systems.

## Leadership and Contributions

Since assuming leadership, Uehara Eriko has:

- Focused on maintaining traditional *denshō* (transmission documents) and kata  
- Conducted public demonstrations across Japan  
- Promoted historical preservation of Hyoho Taisha-ryū’s origins in the Hitoyoshi domain  
- Overseen training at Ryū-Sen-Kan and affiliated dojos

Her leadership is marked by a balance of fidelity to tradition and subtle modern engagement, ensuring the survival and relevance of Taisha-ryū for future generations.

---

## Historical Significance

Uehara’s succession challenges the conventional norms of *koryū bujutsu* leadership, which are overwhelmingly male-dominated. Her role is particularly significant in that it upholds the uninterrupted familial and instructional lineage, rather than introducing an external figurehead. This reinforces the *iemoto* (family headship) model of classical martial transmission while also marking a progressive turn.
