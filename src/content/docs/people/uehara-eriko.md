---

**Uehara Eriko** (上原エリ子), born in the 20th century, is the 15th sōke (headmaster) of **Hyōhō Taisha-ryū**, a traditional Japanese martial arts school (koryū) founded in the late 16th century. She is the granddaughter of the 13th sōke, **Yamakita Takenori**, and the first woman to assume the headmaster position in the school's history :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

### Background and Succession

After the passing of her grandfather, Yamakita Takenori, the sōkeshop briefly passed to her cousin, **Kino Takao**, who served as the 14th sōke. Subsequently, Uehara Eriko was appointed as the 15th sōke, marking a significant moment in the school's lineage :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

### Leadership and Preservation Efforts

As sōke, Uehara oversees the **Ryū-Sen-Kan Dōjō** in Yatsushiro, Kumamoto Prefecture, which serves as the headquarters of Hyoho Taisha-ryu. She works closely with **Yamamoto Takahiro**, the school's shihan (master instructor) and technical leader, to maintain the integrity of the school's teachings and ensure accurate transmission of its curriculum :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

### Contributions to Research and Outreach

Under Uehara's supervision, the **Taisha-ryū Historical Research Group (THRG)** was established to study and preserve the school's rich history. The THRG focuses on:

- Analyzing existing Taisha-ryū documents
- Researching the school's historical development and dissemination
- Acquiring and preserving historical documents
- Creating resources for future research and education :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### International Engagement

Uehara has actively promoted Hyoho Taisha-ryu internationally. In January 2025, she, along with Yamamoto Takahiro, visited the Sydney Study Group in Australia, conducting seminars and demonstrations to share the school's teachings with a global audience :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
