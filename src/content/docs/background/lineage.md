Hyoho Taisha-ryu (兵法タイ捨流) was founded in the late 16th century by **Marume Kurando-no-suke Nagayoshi (丸目蔵人佑長)**, a samurai from Yatsushiro in the Sagara domain of Higo Province (modern-day Kumamoto Prefecture). Marume was a distinguished student of **Kamiizumi Ise-no-Kami Nobutsuna**, the founder of Shinkage-ryu. After years of rigorous training and receiving the menkyo kaiden (license of full transmission) from Kamiizumi, Marume established his own school, integrating his battlefield experiences and philosophical insights.<br><br>

The lineage of Hyoho Taisha-ryu has been preserved through a direct succession of headmasters (sōke), each entrusted with maintaining the school's teachings and traditions. The succession is as follows:<br><br>

1. Founder: Marume Iwami no kami Nyūdō Tesssai Fujiwara Nagayoshi (丸目石見守入道徹斉蔵人佐藤原長恵)
2. Konose Gunsuke Ōkami Tadayuki (神瀬軍助太神惟幸)
3. Sagara Shōjirō Yoritake (相良庄次郎頼武)
4. Sagara Sahei Nagafusa (相良左兵衛長房)
5. Konose Goemon Nyūdō Isai Ōkami Tadanobu (神瀬五右衛門入道牟哉太神惟宜)
6. Oda Shichirouemon Fujiwara Sadanori (小田七郎右衛門 藤原定矩)
7. Oda Sekika Fujiwara Sadanori (小田夕可 藤原定紀)
8. Oda Naozaemon Fujiwara Sadayoshi (小田直左衛門藤原定能)
9. Oda Kindazaemon Fujiwara Sadabumi (小田金駄左衛門藤原定記)
10. Oda Hachirouzaemon Fujiwara Sadanao(小田八郎左衛門藤原定直 )
11. Samuda Chūzō Fujiwara Yoshioki (佐厶田忠蔵藤原良興)
12. Oda Sekika Fujiwara Sadataka (小田夕可藤原定孝)
13. Yamakita Takenori Fujiwara Sadamune (山北 竹任藤原定宗)
14. Kino Takao Fujiwara Sadataka (木野敬夫藤原定敬)
15. Uehara Eriko Fujiwara Hidesada (上原エリ子藤原英定)<br><br>

Throughout its history, Hyoho Taisha-ryu has remained a closed transmission system, taught only by licensed instructors under the authority of the sōke. The school's teachings have been preserved through traditional methods, including the menkyo licensing system and the study of densho (transmission scrolls). This meticulous approach ensures the integrity and continuity of the art from its inception to the present day.<br><br>

The current sōke, **Uehara Eriko**, oversees the Ryusenkan Dojo in Yatsushiro, Kumamoto, which serves as the main dojo (sōhonbu) of Hyoho Taisha-ryu. Under her leadership, the school continues to uphold its centuries-old traditions while also engaging in efforts to document and preserve its rich history for future generations.<br><br>
