## Origin of Hyoho Taisha-ryu

Hyoho Taisha-ryu is a classical Japanese martial tradition (koryu bujutsu) that originated during the Sengoku period, a time of near-constant warfare in Japan. It was founded by **Marume Nagayoshi (1540–1629)**, a retainer of the Sagara clan in southern Kyushu. He developed the system based on his experience in battle, his exposure to various martial traditions, and his studies under the prominent strategist **Kamiizumi Ise-no-Kami Nobutsuna**, founder of Shinkage-ryu.<br><br>

Marume Nagayoshi received formal transmission (menkyo kaiden) from Kamiizumi and later synthesized his learning into his own system: Taisha-ryu. The name can be translated as “Great Teaching School of Strategy” (Hyoho = military strategy, Taisha = great teacher or instruction, Ryu = school). Taisha-ryu was registered with the Satsuma domain as a formal martial system and was practiced by warrior families in the region for generations.<br><br>
